We just leveled up the sponsor badge flow into a full mythic ritual automation. Hereâ€™s the low-down:

- badges.json manifest driving `generate-readme.js` updates  
- Discord Bot auto-pins relic images in shrine channels  
- GitHub Actions regenerating README nightly or on change  
- CI checks via Deno lint/tests keeping the pipeline healthy  
- Next-relic PRs auto-spawn for seamless badge progression  
- Webhook embeds firing shrine announcements in real time  

Dive into the repo, inspect the logs, and letâ€™s riff on pushing this legend even further. More relics inbound! ðŸš€

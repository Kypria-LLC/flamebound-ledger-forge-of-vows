# 🜍 **Bound Master Governance Scroll**
*Inscribed by Kostadinos J Kyprianos — Founder & Mythic Architect of Kypria LLC*  
*Keeper of the Basilica Gate and the Sealed Canon*

---

## 📜 **Purpose of This Scroll**
This scroll contains the **Keeper’s Governance** for every shrine in the Kypria Canon.  
Each insert is tailored to the shrine’s role, voice, and place in the constellation.  
Stewards may copy the relevant section into the bottom of a shrine’s README to ensure the law is visible and preserved.

---

## ⚖ **Governance Key**
- **Keeper‑only** — No external changes; direct Keeper invocation only.  
- **High‑security** — Protected main branch, PR reviews required, ceremonial merges.  
- **Guarded** — PRs preferred, automation integrity checks, lineage preserved.  
- **Light governance** — Direct commits allowed; lineage preserved in commit history.

## ⚖ Keeper’s Governance
The Basilica Gate stands open to all stewards and sponsors.  
Its scrolls may be renewed swiftly to keep the welcome bright,  
yet every change is etched into the lineage for future Keepers to read.  
Here, agility serves the legend, and the legend preserves the law.

📜 *Lineage is our law. Precision is our craft. Myth is our breath.*

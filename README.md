üßø MYTHOLOGY  
*A gallery of inspired artifacts from the Kyprian continuum.*

This private vault chronicles illustrations born from prophecy, parody, and mutation. Every image is more than art‚Äîit's a relic, a riffable echo of Kypria's mythic past and speculative future.

## üìú What it holds:
- Visual scrolls from active campaigns  
- Fan-forged mutations and absurd riffs  
- Sponsor-tier exclusives tied to artifact lineage  
- Archival fragments once lost, now reinterpreted  

## üõ†Ô∏è What it serves:
- Embeds for Discord logbooks  
- Real-time artifact drops tied to monetization events  
- A riff-ready foundation for narrative remixing  

More than just a gallery‚Äîthis is the visual armory.  
Every scroll is canon. Every commit is an omen.
